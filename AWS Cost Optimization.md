# AWS Cost Optimization Guide

Cloud costs on AWS can escalate quickly without visibility and governance. Whether you're running Kubernetes clusters, EC2 workloads, or serverless stacks, applying cost optimization strategies ensures you only pay for what you use—while maximizing performance and scalability.

## Common Cost Drivers in AWS

- Over-provisioned EC2 instances and EBS volumes  
- Unused Elastic IPs, Load Balancers, and Snapshots  
- High S3 storage classes and long retention periods  
- Underutilized RDS/ElastiCache instances  
- Data transfer between regions or AZs  
- Always-on Lambda or Fargate tasks without scaling policies

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. **Right-Size Compute Resources**
- Use **AWS Compute Optimizer** to analyze and recommend instance downsizing.
- Migrate workloads from EC2 to **Graviton-based** instances for cost/performance gains.
- Switch from On-Demand to **Savings Plans** or **Reserved Instances**.

### 2. **Leverage Auto Scaling**
- Enable **Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)** for EC2.
- Use **ECS/Fargate or EKS with Cluster Autoscaler** to avoid idle compute.
- Implement **Lambda concurrency limits** to avoid cost overruns.

### 3. **Use Spot Instances**
- Use **EC2 Spot Instances** for stateless, fault-tolerant workloads.
- Tools like **Cast AI** or **EC2 Auto Scaling mixed instances** automate Spot usage.

### 4. **Optimize Storage**
- Move cold data to **S3 Glacier** or **Intelligent-Tiering**.
- Delete unused **EBS volumes**, **AMIs**, and **snapshots**.
- Enable **EBS volume auto-delete** on termination.

### 5. **Monitor and Visualize Spend**
- Enable **AWS Cost Explorer** and **Budgets** for real-time cost tracking.
- Use **tags and resource groups** for granular cost attribution.
- Integrate with **FinOps tools** like Kubecost, CloudHealth, or Cast AI.

### 6. **Reduce Data Transfer Costs**
- Consolidate workloads in the same region and availability zone.
- Use **S3 Transfer Acceleration** only when absolutely needed.
- Route traffic via **CloudFront** for caching and edge delivery.

## Quick Wins Checklist

- [ ] Turn off idle EC2 and RDS instances  
- [ ] Set up lifecycle rules for S3  
- [ ] Enable cost anomaly detection  
- [ ] Consolidate billing accounts (AWS Organizations)  
- [ ] Automate resource cleanup (via Lambda or Infrastructure-as-Code)

## Tools That Help

- **AWS Cost Explorer**: Native visualization and forecasting  
- **AWS Trusted Advisor**: Cost and performance optimization checks  
- **Cast AI**: Dynamic Kubernetes optimization for AWS  
- **Kubecost**: In-cluster cost monitoring for EKS  
- **Terraform + AWS CLI**: Automate rightsizing and cleanup

## Conclusion

AWS cost optimization is not a one-time task—it’s a continuous practice of auditing, tuning, and automating. By implementing these strategies and leveraging the right tools, you can significantly cut cloud costs while preserving the scalability and flexibility AWS provides.

**Optimize early, automate often, and build FinOps into your engineering culture.**
